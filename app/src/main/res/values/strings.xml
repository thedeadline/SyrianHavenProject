        As of February 2016, the country had resettled 3,097 Syrians (up from 90 in 2013). Following
        the November 2015 Paris attacks, at least 27 state governors declared their refusal to accept
        refugees, or questioned the vetting process. The US State Department has
        affirmed that the country will accept 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016. The USA has
        provided $4.5 billion to aid Syrian refugees as of late December 2015.
